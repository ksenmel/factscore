SENTENCE_INSTRUCT_PROMPT = """Task: Given the following sentence, break it into individual, independent facts. Ensure that each statement is self-contained and does not rely on context from other statements. Replace all pronouns (e.g., 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' 'they') with the corresponding nouns or proper names to make the meaning clear without additional context. Do not change anything in the citations.

Example 1:
Input Sentence: "Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity, which revolutionized modern physics."
Output:
- Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity
- The theory of relativity revolutionized modern physics

Example 2:
Input Sentence: "Michael Collins (October 31, 1930 â€“ April 28, 2021) is a retired American astronaut and test pilot who was the Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission in 1969."
- Michael Collins was born on October 31, 1930
- Michael Collins died on April 28, 2021
- Michael Collins is a retired American astronaut
- Michael Collins is a retired test pilot
- Michael Collins was the Command Module Pilot for the Apollo 11 mission in 1969

Example 4:

Output:
- Bateman has acting roles.
- Bateman has written two short films.
- Bateman has directed two short films.
